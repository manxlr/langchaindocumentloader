# langchaindocumentloader
A langchain prototype app for loading documents and using them for relevant answering from local AI model
The app will accept pdf, doc, csv, xls, txt for now and ingest them to get embeddings. The embedding model
will be as per user choice. The generative llm will be as per user choice as well. The GUI will be in streamlit
The final output should be a standalone program. All data will be included in the standalone program. The ingesting
can be continuous like if we need to add more documents later, then that should be available.
